## The Spark of an Idea

The idea for this blog first struck me on a chilly evening back in January 2022. It sounds simple enough, but launching it was a big challenge that took two full years. The delay wasn't just about setting up a website; it was about becoming ready to share a part of <em>Me</em> with the world. This wasn't just a project; it was a journey of personal growth, and I'm thrilled to finally say: here we are!

## Cheers to My Guiding Stars

No one achieves their dreams alone, and I had some incredible cheerleaders along the way. First, a massive thanks to my mentor, <strong>Moustakim Kifia</strong>. His wisdom has been like a lighthouse in a storm, and he has been a guiding star from day one, always believing in me.

<img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1658920530635-9c849683c20a" alt="lighthouse in a storm" width="600"/>

Then there’s my friend, <strong>Kelvin Adantchede</strong>, my pal from Benin. We met as strangers on a flight to China back in 2017, just two people with big dreams. He was on his way to work on a robotics project, while I was a high school student full of nerves, heading to the <em>Chinese Bridge Competition</em>. Kelvin has been a rock ever since, always pushing me forward.

## Overcoming Technical Roadblocks

Setting up the blog itself was a technical maze. When I discussed buying a domain in China with one of my professors, he advised it would be difficult without a registered company. Thankfully, one of my Chinese classmates came to the rescue, suggesting I use GitHub for hosting and Alibaba Cloud for the domain.

It sounds like an easy fix, but the path was anything but smooth. I fumbled through the domain template verification and called support what felt like a gazillion times. It was a true test of patience, but it taught me a valuable lesson: <strong>persistence pays off!</strong>

## What This Journey Taught Me

Navigating that technical maze and leaning on my support system wasn't just about getting a website online; it was a crash course in personal growth. Every hurdle, from a tricky domain verification to a simple word of encouragement, taught me something valuable. As we step into a new year, I want to share the simple but powerful lessons this journey gave me.

- <strong>Take Small Steps</strong>: Big dreams are built one small step at a time. Breaking your goal down into manageable actions is the key to making real progress.
- <strong>Be Patient</strong>: Meaningful achievements take time. Don't rush the process and remember to be patient and compassionate with yourself along the way.
- <strong>Stay Positive</strong>: A positive mindset is your greatest tool for problem-solving. Even when things get tough, staying optimistic helps you find a way forward.
- <strong>Ask for Help</strong>: It’s not just okay to ask for help,it’s a sign of strength. We all need a helping hand sometimes, and collaboration makes the journey better.
- <strong>Enjoy the Journey</strong>: Don't get so focused on the destination that you forget to appreciate the path. The learning, the growth, and the experience itself are the real rewards.

## Let's Make This Year Great Together

And that’s the message I want to share with all of you as we begin this new chapter: stay hopeful, stay positive. Dream big, work hard, and laugh often.

This year, let’s hold onto these ideas. Let's work on our dreams, have fun doing it, and help each other along the way. We can make this year a great one together.

    content: `Have you ever felt like time is slipping away from you? Like you have so much to do, but not enough hours in the day? If you’re constantly feeling overwhelmed, you are not alone.

My life used to be a mess of chaos, stress, and frustration. I was dominated by an endless to-do list and felt like I had no control over my time or my life. But then, I discovered the secrets that transformed everything. In this post, I’ll share the proven methods I used to plan, prioritize, and execute my tasks efficiently, say no to distractions, and finally say yes to my own goals. You can learn these secrets, too.

## 1. The Foundation: Building a Powerful Morning Routine

The journey began with a gift from a good friend: the book <em>The Miracle Morning</em> by Hal Elrod. This guide teaches you how to create a powerful morning routine by dedicating the first hour of your day to six key activities that boost energy, focus, and motivation.

<img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1737458473627-6817940519d0" alt="morning routine sun" width="600"/>

- <strong>Silence</strong>: Begin your day with quiet meditation, prayer, or reflection.
- <strong>Affirmations</strong>: Repeat positive statements that reinforce your confidence and self-worth.
- <strong>Visualization</strong>: Imagine yourself achieving your goals and living your ideal life.
- <strong>Exercise</strong>: Do some physical activity that gets your blood flowing and your body moving.
- <strong>Reading</strong>: Read something that educates, inspires, or entertains you.
- <strong>Scribing</strong>: Write down your thoughts, feelings, and insights in a journal.

At first, I was skeptical. I thought, “How can waking up early and doing these things make such a big difference?” But I decided to give it a try. The results were amazing. Following this routine, I was able to start each day with a clear mind, a positive attitude, and a sense of purpose. It taught me a fundamental lesson that the book summarizes perfectly:

<blockquote>"How you start your day determines how you live your day, and how you live your day determines how you live your life."</blockquote>

## 2. The Essential Skill: Mastering the Art of "No"

A crucial lesson in time management is learning the art of saying <strong>"no."</strong> As a natural people-pleaser, this was difficult. I realized that by saying yes to everyone and everything, I was effectively saying no to myself, sacrificing my own goals, dreams, and happiness for the sake of others.

Saying "no" is not selfish or rude; it is necessary and respectful. It’s necessary because you have limited time and energy, and it's respectful because you’re being honest and realistic with your commitments.

Here are a few tips to help you say "no" effectively:

- <strong>Be honest but kind</strong>: If you can’t do something, just say so. You don’t need to make up excuses. People appreciate honesty and will respect you for it.
- <strong>Offer a rain check</strong>: If you’re interested but can’t commit now, suggest another time that works for you. This postpones the request without rejecting the person.
- <strong>Keep it short and sweet</strong>: Often, a simple and polite "No, thanks" is all that is needed. You don't always have to justify your decision.

## 3. The Daily Strategy: Executing with Micro-Scheduling

One of the most effective tools I use is <strong>micro-scheduling</strong>,the practice of breaking down your day into small time blocks and assigning specific, granular tasks to each one. For example, instead of writing ‘work on project’ in your calendar, you write ‘work on project: research, outline, draft, edit, proofread’ and allocate a certain amount of time for each subtask.

This technique offers several key benefits:

1. <strong>Enhanced Focus</strong>: A clear plan for each hour minimizes distractions and decision fatigue. You know exactly what to do and when to do it.
2. <strong>Sustained Motivation</strong>: Breaking large projects into smaller subtasks makes them less overwhelming. Completing each small task creates a sense of accomplishment that keeps you going.
3. <strong>Improved Performance</strong>: By estimating and then tracking the actual time a task takes, you can identify areas for improvement and optimize your schedule over time.

<img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1753729213561-0fd9e4669d15" alt="focused workspace" width="600"/>

For this detailed planning, I stick to the basics: a notebook, a pen, and an alarm. The notebook and pen are for creating the micro-schedule and tracking progress. The alarm is my other essential tool; I use it to remind me of tasks, set time limits to stay on track, and signal when it’s time to take a scheduled break.

## 4. The Guiding Philosophy: Simplify and Focus

My guiding principle for all time management decisions is a simple mantra: <strong>"simplify and focus."</strong>

<strong>Simplify</strong> means eliminating the non-essential to make room for what truly matters. It involves decluttering your physical space, your mind, and your schedule by saying no to commitments and tasks that don't align with your priorities.

<strong>Focus</strong> means concentrating on one thing at a time and doing it well. It is the discipline of single-tasking giving your full attention and effort to the task at hand to avoid distractions and produce high-quality work.

## Conclusion: Your Turn to Take Control

Effective time management isn't just about being busy or crossing items off a to-do list; it's about creating a lifestyle that aligns with your personal values and goals. My journey has been an adventure, and now it's your turn to start yours.

For more inspiration on this topic, I highly recommend reading <em>Focus on What Matters</em> by Darius Foroux. It’s a gem that reinforces the importance of staying focused amidst the chaos of daily life.

My transformation has been quite the adventure. Now, it’s your turn. How do you handle the ticking clock? Let’s start a conversation! Thank you so much for reading.

    title: "Oracle Bones: A Personal Journey into the Heart of Ancient Chinese History",
    excerpt: "Stand in awe before 3,000-year-old messages. A personal journey to Anyang that transformed a study of characters into a passion for history.",

    content: `Have you ever seen something that changed your perspective on life? For me, it was standing in a museum in Anyang, China, looking at a 3,000-year-old turtle shell covered in scratches. That artifact, an <strong>oracle bone</strong>, didn't just feel like a piece of history; it felt like a direct line to the ancient world.

In this post, I want to share that personal story. I'll not only explain the historical role of oracle bones but also try to capture the spine-tingling moment of reading a 3,000-year-old question about the future, a moment that closed the gap between their world and mine. This journey made me fall in love with Chinese history, and I'm excited to share it with you.

## What Are Oracle Bones? A Glimpse into the Shang Dynasty

Oracle bones are pieces of animal bone or turtle shell that were used for divination during ancient China’s <strong>Shang dynasty</strong>, which ruled the Yellow River valley in the second millennium BCE. They are far more than simple fortune-telling tools; they represent the earliest known form of Chinese writing and offer a direct window into the highest levels of power in a fascinating and brutal era.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mfaouzia/Mfaouzia.github.io/master/src/img/january/13.jpg" alt="ancient oracle bones script" width="600"/>
During the Shang dynasty, China was a slave society where the king held supreme power. The two most important state affairs were war and sacrifice, and the king relied on divination to make every critical decision. Oracle bones were the medium for this communication with gods and ancestors, making them instruments of state power.

The divination process was a sacred ritual. First, a diviner would meticulously carve questions onto the bone. Then, they would press a heated bronze rod into the bone, causing it to crack under the intense pressure. These cracks were interpreted as the divine answers. Finally, both the answers and, sometimes, the actual outcome of the event were carved onto the bone, creating a permanent record for the royal archives.

## From 'Dragon Bones' to National Treasure: An Accidental Discovery

The story of how oracle bones were rediscovered is as fascinating as the artifacts themselves. In the late 19th century, farmers in Anyang found these inscribed bones while digging for fertilizer. Unaware of their historical significance, they sold them as <strong>"dragon bones"</strong> to traditional medicine dealers, who would grind them into powder for medicinal use.

The pivotal moment came in <strong>1899</strong> when a scholar named <strong>Wang Yirong</strong> fell ill and was prescribed this "dragon bone" medicine. Before it could be ground up, he noticed the strange carvings on the bone fragments. As a scholar of ancient scripts, he recognized them as a form of writing more ancient than any he had ever seen. This accidental discovery revealed their true value, transforming them from a folk remedy into a national treasure.

## A Personal Encounter: My Visit to the Anyang Museum

My own journey with oracle bones began during my trip to the <strong>Chinese Character Museum in Anyang</strong>, which was part of the <em>2023 China (Anyang) International Conference of Chinese Characters</em>. The anticipation I felt walking into the museum was immense. I was about to see, with my own eyes, the very origin of the characters I was working so hard to learn.

Standing in front of the display, I saw it for the first time: a turtle plastron,the flat underside of the shell,covered in ancient script. The sense of connection to the deep past was immediate and profound.

## Decoding a 3,000-Year-Old Message

The museum guide explained that this particular oracle bone dated to the reign of <strong>King Wu Ding</strong>, a powerful Shang ruler who reigned for about 59 years, from 1250 to 1192 BCE. The inscriptions documented a divination ceremony concerning the future millet harvest, a staple food for the Shang people. The questions were carved in neat vertical columns:

- Will there be a good harvest of millet this year?
- Will there be a good harvest of millet next year?
- Will there be a good harvest of millet in three years?

Beside the heat-induced cracks were the answers the diviners had interpreted:

- There will be a good harvest of millet this year.
- There will be a good harvest of millet next year.
- <em>There will not be a good harvest of millet in three years.</em>

I was stunned. This wasn't just an abstract historical object; it was a record of real hopes and fears. In that moment, the true revelation hit me: I could recognize some of the characters and see how they evolved from the pictographic symbols on the bone into the characters I use today. It was a tangible link connecting the present day directly to the ancient world.

## How Ancient Script Rekindled My Passion

This experience was a turning point for me, both personally and academically. It reshaped my interests and gave me a new sense of purpose in my studies.

- <strong>As a Sinophile</strong>: My general interest in Chinese culture had always been strong, but seeing the oracle bone blossomed it into a deep passion for Chinese history. I suddenly needed to know everything about the Shang dynasty and the fascinating evolution of characters.
- <strong>As an International Student</strong>: Learning Chinese characters had often felt like a daunting task. This experience changed that completely. It inspired me to improve my skills because I now see it not as an obstacle but as a logical, beautiful system rooted in history.

## Echoes of History: A Shared Sense of Awe

I wasn't the only one moved by this experience. My friends on the trip felt the same powerful connection to the past.

My friend <strong>Maia</strong> from Hebi City shared this poem:

<img width="250" height="300" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mfaouzia/Mfaouzia.github.io/master/src/img/january/14.jpg" alt="Maia's poem artifact" class="my-6 rounded-lg"/>

<blockquote>
"If there were no oracle bones, Chinese civilization would lose its origin. The long river of history is silent, who can speak of the mystery of writing?
The remnants of the Yin-Shang dynasty are passed down through the ages, turtle shells and animal bones preserve the fragments. Pictographs and ideographs convey profound meanings, cultural treasures are forever transmitted."
</blockquote>

<strong>Ratana Kim</strong> from Cambodia reflected:

<img width="300" height="300" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mfaouzia/Mfaouzia.github.io/master/src/img/january/18.jpg" alt="Ratana Kim's experience" class="my-6 rounded-lg"/>

<blockquote>
"The Anyang Museum was the first place where I saw Chinese oracle bone inscriptions. I felt like I had traveled back to the ancient times of the Shang and Zhou dynasties... Through oracle bones, I can discover a new way of communication."
</blockquote>

## Conclusion: The Enduring Legacy of the Oracle Bones

My encounter with the oracle bones was more than just a museum visit; it was a journey back in time. These remarkable artifacts are a bridge that connects us to the minds and spirits of ancient China. They remind us that behind the grand sweep of history are real people with real concerns.

I hope you enjoyed reading my China story. If you have any questions or comments, please feel free to reach out. I would love to hear from you.

This article is for anyone considering studying in China. Here are five essential tips I've gathered over the years, covering everything from accommodation to culture, to help make your transition smoother.

## 1.0 Navigating Your Living Situation: Dorms, Apartments, and Finances

Your living situation is one of the first things you'll need to sort out. Here’s a breakdown of what to expect regarding accommodation and money.

### 1.1 University Accommodation Rules

Each university has its own regulations, but it is common for international students to be required to live in a campus dormitory for at least the first year. Accommodation options vary, with rooms available for one, two, three, or more people.

A key rule to be aware of is that most universities <strong>do not allow cooking</strong> in dorm rooms. Some, however, provide a common kitchen for residents. It's best to inquire about your specific school’s policies during the application process.

### 1.2 Renting Off-Campus

Fortunately, many universities permit students to rent apartments off-campus. If you choose this option, I strongly advise you to <strong>seek guidance from a friend</strong> who has experience living off-campus. They can help you find a suitable apartment and, more importantly, help you avoid potential scams.

### 1.3 Money Matters and Legal Work Restrictions

When managing your finances, always be aware of the current exchange rate and make sure to <strong>save money for emergencies</strong>. How much you spend will depend entirely on your lifestyle.

It's also crucial to understand the <strong>legal restrictions on employment</strong>. By law, a foreigner on a study visa is not permitted to work. If you are caught working without the proper authorization, you risk having your residence permit canceled and being expelled from the country.

<img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1763924812928-54b2d721cd5c" width="600" alt="Chinese university campus architecture"/>

## 2.0 Essential Apps for Your Smartphone

Your phone will be your lifeline, but you need the right apps to make it truly useful in China.

### 2.1 Getting Connected: VPNs and Communication

Many common applications like Instagram, WhatsApp, TikTok, and Google Maps do not function normally in China without a <strong>VPN (Virtual Private Network)</strong>. Even then, some VPNs may not work reliably. Before you travel, make sure to download <strong>WeChat</strong>. In my opinion, it is the single most useful application for anyone planning a long-term stay.

### 2.2 Must-Have Tools: Payments and Translation

A good translator app that works without a VPN is essential. I personally use <strong>Baidu Translate</strong> and find it very convenient. For payments, <strong>Alipay</strong> is another indispensable app, similar to <strong>WeChat Pay</strong>. To use these, you will need a local Chinese phone number and a Chinese bank account.

### 2.3 For the Savvy Shopper

Once you're settled, consider installing <strong>TaoBao</strong>, a massive online shopping platform where you can find almost anything at a cheap price. Be warned: the app is entirely in Chinese, and scams can be fairly common.

## 3.0 Why Learning Mandarin is Non-Negotiable

If you’re coming to China to study, learning Mandarin is not just a suggestion, it's essential for a successful and enriching experience.

### 3.1 Breaking the Language Barrier

Try to learn some basic Mandarin before you arrive. The first few weeks will be tough, but you will manage. The key is to <strong>practice whenever you can</strong>, whether with locals or other international students. Don't be shy about making mistakes; it's part of the process.

### 3.2 Common Conversations to Expect

Locals are often curious and friendly. Be prepared for a few common questions:
- “你是哪里的?” (Where are you from?)
- “你多大呀?” (How old are you?)
- “哇！你中文说得这么好!” (Wow! Your Chinese is so good!)

### 3.3 Recommended Dictionary Apps

I recommend two free Chinese-English dictionary apps: <strong>Hanping</strong> and <strong>Pleco</strong>. They are excellent tools for basic learning and quick lookups.

## 4.0 Embracing the Culture: People and Perspectives

China is a vast country with over 1.4 billion people, so it's impossible to generalize experiences. Your interactions will be varied.

### 4.1 A Spectrum of Encounters

During your stay, you will meet a wide range of people. Some will be incredibly open-minded, while others might be more reserved. In my experience, most people fall somewhere in the middle.

### 4.2 The Power of Speaking the Language

Believe me when I say that your <strong>ability to speak Chinese can transform your interactions</strong>. As soon as people realize you can communicate, they often open up, ask questions, and want to engage in conversation.

## 5.0 A Word of Caution: Navigating Local Sensitivities

While embracing the culture, it's also important to be mindful of local norms and regulations.

### 5.1 Mindful Communication

I can only urge you to be <strong>careful about what you say</strong> and what you send in messages, as you could be held accountable. As a foreign guest, it is wise to avoid discussing taboo topics or the country's political system. This advice isn't about "living on eggshells," but rather about being mindful and respectful.

## 6.0 Conclusion: Your Path to a Successful Stay

Ultimately, a successful stay in China comes down to a few key principles: <strong>show respect for everyone</strong>, learn the basic local etiquette, be mindful of your actions, and, as a student, <strong>work hard</strong>. The journey from an uncertain eighteen-year-old to a confident student was built on these principles.

In today's digital age, we rely on the internet for nearly everything from work and education to communication and entertainment. This constant connection, however, exposes us to significant risks like cyberattacks, identity theft, data breaches, and malware infections. Protecting your online data and devices is crucial for your security and privacy. This article provides simple, effective tips you can use to enhance your online security and protect your personal data from common cyber threats.

## 2.0 Strengthen Your First Line of Defense: Password Management

Passwords are the keys to your online accounts, and using weak or reused ones leaves you vulnerable. Hackers can exploit them to access your personal and financial information or use your accounts for malicious purposes. To keep your accounts secure, follow these best practices:

- <strong>Use Unique Passwords</strong>: Use a different password for every online account. This ensures that if one password is compromised in a data breach, your other accounts will remain secure.
- <strong>Create Complexity</strong>: A strong password should be long and random, incorporating a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Avoid using personal or easily guessable information like your name, birthday, or even your favorite movie.
- <strong>Use a Password Manager</strong>: A password manager is a tool that generates, securely stores, and automatically fills in complex passwords for you. Popular options include LastPass, Dashlane, and 1Password.

## 3.0 Add a Second Lock: The Power of Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) is an essential second layer of security that goes beyond just a password. When you log in, 2FA requires you to provide a second factor of verification, such as a code sent to your phone, a fingerprint scan, or a physical key. This means that even if a hacker steals your password, they cannot access your account without the second factor. It is highly recommended to enable 2FA on all sensitive accounts, including email, banking, and social media.

## 4.0 Keep Your Digital Doors Locked: The Importance of Software Updates

Software updates are critical for your security. These updates often contain "patches" that fix security vulnerabilities that hackers can exploit to gain unauthorized access to your devices and data. By regularly updating your software, you protect your devices from the latest cyber threats. It is important to update the software on all your devices, including your computer, smartphone, tablet, or smartwatch as well as your antivirus and firewall software. Enable automatic updates where possible.

## 5.0 Navigate the Web Wisely: Safe Browsing Habits

Safe browsing practices are crucial habits for avoiding online threats. These threats include phishing, malware, and ransomware. To practice safe browsing, follow these tips:

- <strong>Look for the Lock</strong>: Only use websites with HTTPS enabled, which you can identify by the lock icon. HTTPS sites encrypt your traffic, preventing hackers from intercepting it.
- <strong>Enhance Your Browser</strong>: Install reputable browser extensions to enhance your security and privacy. Extensions like HTTPS Everywhere, Privacy Badger, or uBlock Origin can encrypt your traffic and block trackers.
- <strong>Think Before You Click</strong>: Avoid clicking on unknown or suspicious links and attachments. You can hover your mouse over a link to see its true destination before clicking.
